# Translational Motion Simulation with Friction

## This program simulates an object's horizontal motion subject to Coulomb friction. Users can change velocity and coefficient values to observe changes in visual plots.
 
### Installation
### Install the required Python packages by running:
### ```pip install numpy plotly``` 
### numpy -> for mathematical calculations
### plotly -> for interactive plots
